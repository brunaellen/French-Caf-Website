          great cafe! all the good comments are true
          This is such a great cafe, the only problem 
          is that it is quite small with limited seating. 
          Great place to go for breakfast.

          <li><strong>March 15th 2020</strong></li>
          Been visiting the French Café for around 18 months now 
          on an almost weekly basis.
          It serves good hearty fresh food, and 
          brilliant cakes and refill coffee's.
          It is always very busy at lunch times, 
          so we tend to go a little earlier or later.

          There's nothing better than 
          a local cafe where all the 
          food is cooked fresh from high quality ingredients!
          Such a great place!
